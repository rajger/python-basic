# Why Python

Usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle of C/C++/Java is too slow. Shell scripting is simple but not suitable for GUI applications or games. Python combines the power of C/C++/Java with simplicity of shell scripts. Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs â€” or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development.

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:

  . the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
  . statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
  . no variable or argument declarations are necessary.
